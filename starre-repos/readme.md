Great — here’s a concise, step‑by‑step how-to so you can run the exporter and auto-group scripts I gave you, inspect the suggestions, and get a polished set of list names + starter items. I’ll tell you what I did (prepared the scripts) and then show exactly what to run, what files are produced, how to change the grouping rules, and what to do next.

What I prepared for you

- export_stars_gh.sh — export starred repos using the GitHub CLI (recommended).
- export_stars_curl.sh — export starred repos using curl and a Personal Access Token (if you don't use the GH CLI).
- group_stars.py — Python script that groups the exported repos into sensible lists and writes star_groups.md + star_groups.json.
- suggested_lists.md — a ready set of list names and short descriptions you can use.

Prerequisites

- A POSIX shell (Linux / macOS / WSL). Windows PowerShell will work with small adjustments.
- gitHub CLI (gh) v2+ OR curl + a GitHub Personal Access Token.
- jq (for CSV extraction) — optional but recommended.
- Python 3.8+.

Quick checklist commands

- Install gh: https://cli.github.com/ (or via package manager)
- Install jq:
  - macOS: brew install jq
  - Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install jq
- Check python version:
  python3 --version

Step-by-step: recommended (gh CLI)

1. Save the script file export_stars_gh.sh into a folder.
2. Make it executable and run it:

```bash
chmod +x export_stars_gh.sh
./export_stars_gh.sh
```

Notes:

- Ensure gh is authenticated: gh auth status
- The script uses: gh api --paginate "/users/o9-9/starred"
- Outputs: stars.json (full API response) and stars.csv (compact fields)

Step-by-step: alternative (curl + token)
If you prefer not to use gh, create a personal access token and export it to an environment variable:

- Create token: Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens. For public starred repos you don't need special scopes; however a token simplifies rate limits.
- Export token (example):

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN="ghp_XXXXXXXXXXXX"
chmod +x export_stars_curl.sh
./export_stars_curl.sh
```

Outputs: stars.json and stars.csv

Run the grouping script

1. Ensure stars.json is in the same directory.
2. Make script executable and run:

```bash
chmod +x group_stars.py
python3 group_stars.py
```

What it produces

- star_groups.md — human readable Markdown file. Each section is a suggested list title + short description and the top matching starred repos for that list (first 12 items per list by default).
- star_groups.json — JSON mapping group name → list of repo objects (compact).

Example commands to run the whole flow at once (gh flow):

```bash
chmod +x export_stars_gh.sh group_stars.py
./export_stars_gh.sh
python3 group_stars.py
```

If you used curl:

```bash
chmod +x export_stars_curl.sh group_stars.py
./export_stars_curl.sh
python3 group_stars.py
```

Inspecting the results

- Open star_groups.md in your editor or browser to review suggested list names, descriptions and example items.
- If you want me to polish the final lists further, paste the contents of star_groups.md here and I’ll produce the final set of list names, one‑line descriptions, and a suggested first‑item ordering for each list.

Customizing grouping behavior

- Edit group_stars.py to change category names, descriptions, or keyword heuristics.
  - The CATEGORIES variable is a list of tuples: (name, description, [regex patterns]).
  - Add patterns or tweak names to better match your starred repos.
- To allow multi-category assignment (put repo into multiple lists), change the assignment loop to not break after first match.
- To increase the number of example items per list, change the slice items[:12] in the script.

Common troubleshooting

- stars.json missing: ensure the export ran successfully. Look for API rate limit or auth errors printed by the export script.
- gh api 401: run gh auth login to authenticate.
- curl 401: make sure GITHUB_TOKEN is exported and valid.
- jq errors: install jq or remove the CSV-export lines (they're optional).

How to turn these suggestions into GitHub Stars lists

- star_groups.md is a draft with list titles and repo links. GitHub’s UI for starred “Lists” is manual (create a new list and add repos), so the simplest path is:
  1. Open GitHub → Your profile → Stars → Create new list.
  2. Use the list names and one-line descriptions from star_groups.md.
  3. Add the listed repositories to each list manually (use the repo URLs provided).
- If you’d like an automated way to create lists via API or a browser automation script, tell me and I’ll provide a gh-cli or small Puppeteer script (note: GitHub API changes; some UI-only features may require GraphQL or web automation).

What I recommend as next steps (one simple path)

1. Run the gh export script:
   ./export_stars_gh.sh
2. Run the grouping:
   python3 group_stars.py
3. Open star_groups.md and paste it here — I’ll:
   - Produce a final curated list of names + one-line descriptions.
   - Pick the best first 6–12 repositories to be the starter items for each list.
   - Give you a concise checklist to create the lists in the GitHub UI (or produce an automation script if you want to automate).

If you want, I can also:

- Customize the heuristics to match languages or topics I detect in your stars (I’ll need star_groups.md).
- Create a single command/workflow to re-run the export+group regularly (cron or GitHub Action).
- Provide a script to automatically open the repo pages in your browser for each suggested list so you can add them quickly to GitHub lists.

Which option do you want to do next?

- A: I’ll walk you through running the gh export + grouping locally and you paste star_groups.md here.
- B: I create an automation script to build GitHub lists automatically (I’ll need to explain risks/limitations).
- C: You want me to tweak grouping heuristics first (tell me which focus/categories you prefer).

Tell me which path and I’ll continue — or paste star_groups.md if you already ran the scripts and want me to finalize the lists.
