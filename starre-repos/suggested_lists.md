# Suggested GitHub Stars Lists (descriptive + ready-to-use)

Below is a curated set of lists following best-practices (concise, searchable, consistent punctuation and optional emoji). Use these as your primary lists; the group_stars.py script will fill each with the top matching repos from your export.

Recommended lists (name — short description)
- ✨ Favorites — Go-to tools & libs
  - Daily drivers and libraries I reach for constantly.
- 📚 Learning — Tutorials & Guides

How this maps to star_groups.md:
- Each section is a suggested list title + short description, followed by the top items from your starred repos that match.
- star_groups.md is safe to use as a draft — edit names or descriptions and move repos into lists as you prefer.

Tips:
- Keep list names short (<= 40 chars) and keyword-first for searchability.
- Use emoji for quick visual scanning but keep them consistent.
- Periodically run the exporter and the grouping script to refresh — then prune/archive stale lists with "📦 Archived — Old".
