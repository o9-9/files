Nice — here's a compact, practical guide plus ready-to-use, beautiful list names you can copy into GitHub Stars (or any bookmarking system) to keep your starred repositories clean, scannable and pleasant to browse.

Principles (short)

- Be concise: aim for ~20–40 characters (keeps UI tidy).
- Keyword-first: put searchable terms up front so sorting/search works.
- Consistent style: choose Title Case or Sentence case and stick to it.
- Use emoji sparingly for fast visual scanning and category color-coding.
- Include context when needed (year, status, language): e.g., “2025”, “WIP”, “Read-Later”.
- Prefer nouns for categories and verbs for action lists: “Boilerplates” vs “To Try”.
- Purpose first: name by what a list is for, not just the topic:
  “Learning”
  “Playground”
  “Production-ready”

Naming templates you can reuse

- <emoji> Topic — Purpose/Scope
  - Example: "📚 JavaScript — Tutorials & Guides"
- <emoji> Topic / Subtopic
  - Example: "⚙️ DevOps / CI-CD"
- Keyword — Status (short)
  - Example: "UI Components — Production"
- Year-tagged:
  - Example: "Top Picks 2025 — Best Tools"

Good vs not-good examples

- Good: "🎨 UI Components — React & Web" (clear, searchable, concise)
- Bad: "Stuff I like for frontend that might be useful later but not sure" (too long, vague)

Style conventions (pick one and apply)

- Emoji + Title Case + short subtitle: "🔧 Dev Tools — CLI & Extensions"
- No emoji + keyword prefix: "DevOps / CI-CD"
- Use separators consistently: choose either "—" or ":" or "/"

Practical tips for maintenance

- Start with 8–12 lists, then refine after a month.
- Archive a list "📦 Archived — Old / Unused" instead of deleting.
- Rename with year for time-bound lists (e.g., "Top Picks 2025").
- Periodically (quarterly) prune stale stars and move repos between lists.
- Keep list names under ~40 chars so they display cleanly everywhere.

Want me to make a suggested set specifically from your starred repos?

- If you share themes you see in your stars (frontend, ML, infra, tutorials, etc.), I’ll generate a tailored list set and 1-line descriptions for each list.
- If you want, I can also give you a short script (curl / gh CLI) to export your starred repos so we can auto-group them.

Would you like:

1. A compact set (8 lists) I create for your account based on common patterns, or
2. A full custom categorization including short descriptions and suggested first items for each list (I’ll need at least the main topics you’re interested in)?
